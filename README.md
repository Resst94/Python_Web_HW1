Task #1.

1. Draw a UML diagram of your final project "Personal Assistant" from the last course. You can use the free draw.io or any other application you prefer.

2. Your previous application now works in console mode and interacts with the user in the form of commands in the console. The application needs to be developed and the most frequently changed part of the application is usually the user interface (for now, it's the console). Modify the code of your application so that the presentation of information to the user (displaying cards with user contacts, notes, a page with information about available commands) is easy to change. To do this, you need to describe an abstract base class for user views and specific implementations that inherit the base class and implement the console interface.
